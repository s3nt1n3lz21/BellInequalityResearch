# BellInequalityResearch
Summer 2017 Research Project

Code to calculate the maximum classical value of any bell inequality of the class of scenarios (n,2,m). Note throughout the scenarios are denoted (n,d,m) in that order where n is the number of parties, d is the number of measurement outcomes and m is the number of measurement settings. This is instead of the usual notation of (n,m,d) since the deterministic probabilities are written D_n_i(d_i|m_i) and makes the code easier to read and understand.
